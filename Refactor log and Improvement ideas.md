# [Refactor](https://refactoring.guru/) log

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class should have only one reason to change. Separated classes for handling VAT registration for each country. The code is now more modular and easier to understand.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The system should be open for extension but closed for modification. Created an interface to define the VAT registration strategy and implement it for each country.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Injected dependencies rather than creating them inside the class.

This approach makes the code more maintainable and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new countries or changes to existing registration processes.

Testability: Using interfaces and dependency injection the code become more testable. Each component can be tested in isolation using mocks.

Added structured logging using ILogger to track key events and errors.

Introduced custom exceptions (e.g., UnsupportedCountryException).
Returned appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).

Changed from .Wait() to await.
    .Wait():
        A blocking call. This forces the current thread to wait synchronously for the task to complete.
        In a web application, this can lead to thread pool exhaustion because the thread is blocked and cannot be used to handle other requests.
		This can cause deadlocks, especially when used on the main thread (e.g., in a controller).
		This wraps any exceptions in an AggregateException, which makes it harder to handle specific exceptions.
    await:
        This is a non-blocking call. It asynchronously waits for the task to complete, freeing up the thread to handle other requests while waiting.
        This improves scalability and performance, especially under high load.
		This avoids deadlocks because it doesn't block the thread.
		This throws the original exception, making it easier to catch and handle specific errors.

# Improvement ideas

Moving the application to Azure can provide significant benefits in terms of security, scalability, reliability, performance, and cost efficiency.
    Scalability: Handle varying loads with auto-scaling.

    Reliability: Ensure high availability with redundancy and failover.

    Performance: Optimize with caching, CDN, and global deployment.

    Cost Efficiency: Pay only for what you use and optimize costs with serverless options.

    Security: Protect data and applications with built-in security features.

    Global Reach: Serve users worldwide with low latency.
	
Adding user authentication and authorization is crucial for securing the application and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific endpoints or perform certain actions.

Add more, higher level tests.

Stricter validation of VatRegistrationRequest.

Test for Security Vulnerabilities.

Adding Versioning to the API.

Use a Mediator Pattern
Instead of directly calling the strategy factory in the controller, use the Mediator pattern to decouple the controller from the business logic.

Use a Result Pattern
Instead of throwing exceptions for business rules (e.g., unsupported country), use a Result pattern to return success/failure states.

Add Health Checks
Add health checks to monitor the APIâ€™s dependencies (e.g., database, external services).

Use a retry mechanism to handle transient failures.
Log API failures and return a meaningful error message to the client.
